# Pallet Roadmap

This file list features or capabilities the the pallet project plans
to incorporate in the future. While a specific timeline or release is not
specified they are listed in priority order. The contents of this roadmap
will change over time, both priority and context as discussions and work
continues.

Roadmap items are not considered formally under development or plan until
feature issues are created to represent the development.

## Constraint Planner

Development of a scheduler planner implementation that utilized the constraint
policies as defined in the turnbuckle project
(`https://github.com/ciena/turnbuckle`).

## Multicluster Support

Support planned scheduling across multiple clusters through integration with
one of the multi-cluster projects such as `KubeFed`.
